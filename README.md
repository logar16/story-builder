# Story Builder
Idea here is to create a web app which helps make creating consistent, coherent stories easier.  It tracks the who, what (things/items), where (x, y, time), and when for you, so you can focus on the what (actions) and the why.

## Features

### Map
* Upload your own map (maybe someday build your map here).  
* Annotate the map with geographical features and cities/countries

### Character/Item Tracking
* Create characters and items with annotations
* Place characters or items around the map and add snapshots of location at different times.
* Get notes about unrealistic travel

### Watch the Plot Thicken
* See the story come to life as characters move about the map and interact
* Have notes of the story plot play along with the animation, allowing you to follow along





## React Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
